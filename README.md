# Windows-Operations-Labs

Welcome to my  Windows operations repository for cybersecurity. These labs demonstrate my proficiency in configuring, securing, and managing Windows environments to ensure robust system performance and resilience against cyber threats. Through hands-on exercises, I cover a range of topics including Active Directory management, Group Policy configuration, PowerShell scripting for automation, and implementing security measures such as endpoint protection and access controls. Each lab includes detailed documentation outlining objectives, methodologies, tools used, and outcomes achieved, reflecting my commitment to thoroughness and best practices in Windows operations. Explore these repositories to see how I integrate operational excellence with cybersecurity principles to optimize Windows environments effectively.
